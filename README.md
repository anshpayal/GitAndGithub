Basics of Git and GitHub.

### Version control system
- It is system that allows you to record changes to files over the time.
- Version control system(VCS) tracks the history of changes as people and team made.
- It tracks: which changes are made, who made the changes, when were the changes made, why were changes needed.

### Types of version control system
- There are three types of VCS: Local, Centralized and Distributed
- In Local Version control system, you manage all the version of files only within your local system. There is no remote server. All changes are recorded in local database. 
- In Centralized Version control system, you have a single "central" repository and each user get their own working copy. Whenever you commit the changes it will directly reflect to the central repository. To view the changes done to the repository, other users have to update it from central repository.
- In Distributed Version control system, there is a local copy of the repo for every developer on their own computer. They can make whatever changes they want and commit without affecting the remote repo. They first commit in their local repo and then push the changes to remote repo.
